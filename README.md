## 📖 Usage Examples

**Interactive Mode:**
```
Keep English as your primary language? (y/n): n
Enter your primary language code: spa

Result: Keeps spanish, spa, es, es-mx, es-es
        Archives all other languages
```

**Command Line:**
```batch
SubScrub.bat spa
```

### Scenario 2: Bilingual Library (English + Spanish)

**Interactive Mode:**

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Scans** your media directory for subtitle files
2. **Analyzes** filenames for language codes
3. **Detects** duplicate subtitles
4. **Keeps** subtitles matching your language preference
5. **Archives** all other subtitles to a backup folder (structure preserved)
6. **Cleans** empty folders (optional)
7. **Logs** everything in detailed reports

### What Gets Kept vs Archived?

**KEPT:**
- Files matching your selected language(s)
- Example: `movie.eng.srt`, `show.en.srt`, `video.english.srt`

**ARCHIVED:**
- All other subtitle files
- Example: `movie.spa.srt`, `show.fre.vtt`, `video.ger.ass`

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Antivirus Blocks SubScrub.exe
**Solution:** Use `SubScrub.bat` instead (no antivirus issues)

### Files Not Detected as English
**Check:** Filename must contain language code (e.g., `movie.eng.srt`)  
**Solution:** Add alternative codes when prompted

### Empty Folders Won't Delete
**Note:** Normal on network drives - Windows holds file handles briefly  
**Solution:** Script includes 100ms delay to help. You can delete manually if needed.

### Want to Restore Archived Subtitles?
1. Navigate to your backup folder
2. Find the timestamped backup (e.g., `Backup_20240214_153217`)
3. Copy files back to original locations (check `archive_log.txt` for paths)
